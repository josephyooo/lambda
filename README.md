A dumb personal discord bot written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.6 using the cogs rewrite version of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

I made this while also learning git, so there may be some mistakes between branches that I haven't caught yet.

If you want to use it, use your own [discord bot token](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me), [reddit user account](https://www.reddit.com/register), [owm api key](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys), [google api key](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/guide/aaa_apikeys), and google custom search engine id.
